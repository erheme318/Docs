# The importance of (self) questioning

Recently, I have realised that how important it is to ask questions while reading (reviewing our colleague's code), to make better a decision and to explore possibilities while resolving a problem. So why questioning is important ?

I think there are sevaral benefits:

 - To make sure that you understand correctly before making a criticism (How to read a book)
 - It activates our analytical brain: exploring possibilities (Thinking fast and slow)
 - To make a better decision (How life imitates chess)

So these questions such as *why*, *why not*, *what if* activate our analytical brain and widen our perspective. Thus, we are starting to explore/brainstorm the possibilities instead of limiting ourselves by the System1 which is automatic response of our brain in current situation.

So if you only do what the requirement says without self-questioning, you may say that you did a job done but the true value of your work is less valuable than the job that you could have done while self-questioning yourself.

In other words, the work you have done without self-questioning, you did the execution part of the work only. But if you self-question yourself, you may figure out what customers are trying to solve and tackle with it through experiments in order to help them, now your work is much more valuable than before, you did not only execution but also took the initiative.
