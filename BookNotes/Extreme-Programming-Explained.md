## Diversity

p.29

Software development teams where everyone is alike, while comfortable, are not effective. Teams need to bring together a variety of skills, attitudes, and perspectives to see problems and pitfalls, to think of multiple ways to solve problems, and to implement the solutions. *Teams need diversity*.

## Planning

p. 95

Write stories on index cards and put the cards on a prominent wall. Many teams try to skip this step and go straight to a computerized version of the stories. I've never seen this work. Nobody believes stories more because they are on a computer. It is the interaction around the stories that makes them valuable.The cards are a tool. *The interaction* and *alignment of goals*, shared belief in the stories, are the valuable part. You can't automate relationships. *The goal is to have a plan everyone believes in and is working to fulfill*.
