# Thinking Fast & Slow

# Introduction

Aim: Improve the ability to identify and understand errors of judgment and choice, in others and eventually in ourselves. (p.4)

It's much easier to strive for perfection when you are never bored. (p.6)

We quickly adopted a practice the we maintain for many years.

The reliance on the heuristic (resemblance of Steve's personality to that of a stereotypical librarian) caused predictable biases (systemic errors) in their prediction. (p.7)

Skill and heuristics are alternative sources of intuitive judgments and choices. (p.11)

**Intuitive heuristics**

When faced with a difficult questions, we often answer on easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution. (p.12)

# Two systems

**Fast thinking**

It includes both variants of intuitive thought - the expert and the heuristic - as well as the entirely automatic activities of perception and memory. (p.13)

**Slow thinking**

More deliberate and effortful form of thinking.
A prototype of slow thinking: *deliberate*, *effortful*, and *orderly*.

The division of labor between System1 and System2 is highly efficient: It minimizes effort and optimizes performance.

To resist the illusion, there is only one thing you can do:
 *you must learn to mistrust your impression.*

It is easier to recognize other people's mistake than our own.

Anything that occupies your working memory reduces your ability to think. (p.30)

## Law of least effort

If there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action.

**Flow**

A state of effortless concentration so deep that they loose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems.


**Ego depletion**

The phenomenon that an effort of will or self-control is tiring; if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able
to exert self control when the next challenge comes around.


**The lazy System 2**

When people believe a conclusion in true, they also very likely to believe arguments that appear to support it, even when these arguments
are unsound. (p.45)

If System 1 is involved, the conclusion comes first and the arguments follow.

Intelligence is not only the ability to reason, it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed. (p.46)

Don't be tempted to accept a superficially plausible answer that comes readily to mind.

Individuals who unwilling to invest the effort needed to check their intuitions, are also prone to accept other suggestions from System 1.

System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy. (p.48)

## The Associative machine

 - Priming

## Cognitive ease

*Cognitive ease* ~ pastness => the experience of familiarity


**Illusion of remembering**

The quality of pastness is an illusion. The illusion of familiarity comes from cognitive ease. The impression of familiarity is produced by System 1,
and System 2 relies on that impression for a true/false judgment.

**How to write a persuasive message**

If you make about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simple language will do. In addition to making your message
simple, try to make it memorable.

 - Put your ideas in verse if you can

**Strain and Effort**

Cognitive Strain, whatever its source, mobilizes System 2, which is more likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System 1. (p.64)


**The pleasure of cognitive ease**

Mere exposure effect - the link between the repetition of an arbitrary stimulus and the mild affection that people eventually have for it.

The consequence of repeated exposures benefit the organism in its relations to the immediate animate and inanimate environment.
They allow the organism to distinguish objects and habitats that are safe from those that aren't, and they are the most primitive
basis of social attachments. Therefore, they form the basis for social organization and cohesion - the basic sources of psychological
and social stability.

A feature of System 1 that cognitive ease is associated with good feelings.

The range of the cognitive ease is between "Ease" and "Strained".
 - "Easy" is a sign that things are going well - no threats, no major news, no need to redirect attention or mobilize effort.
 - "Strained" indicates that a problem exists, which will require increased mobilization of System 2.

*Cognitive ease is both a cause and a consequence of a pleasant feeling.*


Good mood, intuition, creativity, gullibility, and increased reliance on System 1 form a cluster. At the other pole, sadness, vigilance, suspicion, an analytical approach and increased effort also go together.

**Ease mood and intuition**

A happy mood loosens the control of System 2 over performance:
When in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors.

## A Machine for jumping to conclusions

**Neglect of ambiguity and suppression of doubt:**

When uncertain, System 1 bets on an answer, and the bets are guided by experience. The rules of the betting are intelligent:
recent events and the current context have the most weight in determining an interpretation.

"Let's decorrelate errors by obtaining separate judgment on the issue before any discussion. We will get more information from independent assessments."


**Mental shotgun**

Excess computation that System 1 carries it out. In other words, an intention to answer one question evoked another, which wasn't only superfluous but actually detrimental to the main task.

**Availability bias**

People remember their own individual efforts and contributions much more clearly than those of the others. So the self-estimated contributions add up to more than 100%.

**Affect heuristic**

People make judgments and decisions by consulting their emotions: Do I like it? Do I hate it? How strongly do I feel about it?

Slovic said:
"People form opinions and make choices that directly express their feelings and their basic tendency to approach or avoid, often without knowing that they are doing so."


The essential keys to disciplined Bayesian reasoning can be simply summarized:
 - Anchor your judgment of the probability of an outcome on a plausible base rate
 - Question the diagnosticity of your evidence


*We must allow for that uncertainty in our thinking*


Representativeness belongs to a cluster of closely related basic assessments that are likely to be generated together.
The most representative outcomes combine with the personality description to produce the most coherent stories.
The most coherent stories are not necessarily the most probable, but they are plausible, and the notions of coherence,
plausibility, and probability are easily confused by the unwary.

The evaluation of plausibility and coherence does not suggest and answer to the probability question. In the absence of a competing intuition, logic prevails. (p.159)


## The illusion of validity

*What makes him believe that he is smarter than the market ?
Is this an illusion of skill*

*She is hedgedog. She has a theory that explains everything, and it gives her the illusion that she understands the world.*

**Intuition vs Formulas**

The research suggests a surprising conclusion: to maximize predictive accuracy, final decisions should be left to formulas,
especially in low-validity environments.

Intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment. (p.241)


Whether professionals have a chance to develop intuitive expertise depends essentially on the quality and speed of feedback,
as well as on sufficient opportunity to practice.

The unrecognised limits of professional skill help explain why experts are often overconfident.


Intuitions are likely to be skilled when both of following conditions are satisfied:
 - An environment that is sufficiently regular to be predictable
 - An opportunity to learn these regularities through prolonged practice

But this is what always happens when a project ends reasonably well: once you understand the main conclusion,
it seems it was always obvious.

There are many ways for any plan to fail, and although most of them are too improbable to be anticipated,
the likelihood that something will go wrong in a big project is high.

**Planning fallacy**

 - are unrealistically close to best-case scenarios.
 - could be improved by consulting the statistics of similar cases.


Using distributional information from other ventures similar to that being forecasted is called taking an "outside view"
and is the cure to the planning fallacy.

Award-winning CEOs subsequently underperform after the business press anoints them as celebrities.


Bernoulli's insight was that a decision maker with diminishing marginal utility for wealth will be risk averse. (p.274)


**Theory induced blindness**

Once you have accepted a theory and used it as a tool in your thinking, it is extraordinarily difficult to notice its flaws.
If you come upon an observation that does not sees to fit the model, you assume that there must be a perfectly good explanation
that you are somehow missing. (p.277)

Disbelieving is hard work, and System 2 is easily tired as the psychologist Daniel Gilbert observed.

In science complexity is considered a cost (which must be justified by it's advantages). (p.281)


## Prospect Theory

In mixed gambles, where both a gain and a loss are possible, loss aversion causes extremely risk-averse choices.

In bad choices, where a sure loss is compared to a large loss that is merely probable, diminishing sensitivity causes risk seeking.


Improbable outcomes are overweighted - this is the possibility effect.
Outcomes that are almost certain are underweighted relative to actual certainty.

When an unlikely event becomes the focus of attention, we will assign it much more weight than its probability deserves. (p.316)

People buy more than protection against an unlikely disaster; they eliminate a worry and purchase piece of mind. (p.318)

Regret is an emotion and it is also a punishment that we administer to ourselves. (p.346)


The **acquisition of skills** requires a *regular environment*, *an adequate opportunity to practice*, and *rapid and unequivocal feedback
about the correctness of thoughts and actions*. (p.416)

Observers are less cognitively busy and more open to information than actors.
