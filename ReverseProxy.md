# Reverse proxy

A reverse proxy server is **a server** that typically sits in front of other web servers in order to provide additional functionality that the web servers may not provide themselves.
For example, a reverse proxy can provide SSL termination, load balancing, request routing, caching, compression or even A/B testing.
