# Scrum

## Introduction

Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products

## Empirical process control

Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism.
Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making
decisions based on what is known. Scrum employs an **iterative**,
**incremental** approach to optimize predictability and control risk.

Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control:
 - Transparency
 - Inspection
 - Adaptation

## Points

 - Backlog is emergent
 - Interruptions and distractions that don't contribute to Sprint goals are **impediments**

## Pre-Scrum (The Roots of SCRUM)

### Rugby approach

A holistic or "rugby" approach - where a team tries to go the distance as a unit,
passing the ball back and forth.

Under the rugby approach, the product development process emerges from the constant
interaction of a hand-picked, multidisciplinary team whose members work together from
start to finish.

The team engages in iterative experimentation. This goes on in even the latest phases
of the development process.

This approach is essential for companies seeking to develop new products quickly and
flexibly.

An approach encourages **trial and error** and challenges the status quo. This strategy
for the product development can act as an agent of change for the larger organization.

### Moving the scrum downfield

Six characteristics in managing new product development processes:
 1. Built-in instability
 2. Self-organizing project teams
 3. Overlapping development phases
 4. "Multi-learning"
 5. Subtle control
 6. Organizational transfer of learning

 Each element, by itself, does not bring about speed and flexibility. But taken as a whole,
 the characteristics can produce a powerful new set of dynamics that will make a difference.

#### Built-in Instability

Top management kicks off the development process by signaling a broad goal or a general
strategic direction. It rarely hands out a clear-cut new product concept or a specific work
plan. But it offers a project team a wide measure of freedom and also establishes extremely
challenging goals.

Top management creates an element of tension in the project team by giving it great freedom
to carry out a project of strategic importance to the company and by setting very challenging
requirements.

#### Self-organizing Project Teams

A project team takes on a self-organizing character as it is driven to a state of
"zero information" - where prior knowledge does not apply.

The project team begins to operate like a start-up company - it takes **initiatives and
risks** and develops an independent agenda.

A group possesses a self-organizing capability when it exhibits three conditions:
 1. Autonomy
 2. Self-transcendence
 3. Cross-fertilization

**Autonomy**

Headquarters' involvement is limited to providing guidance, money, and moral support at
the outset. On a day-to-day basis, top management seldom intervenes; *team is free to set
its own direction*.

>
It's incredible how the company called in young engineers like ourselves to design a car
with a totally new concept and gave us the freedom to do it our way.

> a member of the Honda City project team

**Self-transcendence**

The project teams appear to be absorbed in a never-ending quest for "the limit".
Starting wit guidelines set forth by top management, they begin to establish their own
goals and keep on elevating them throughout the development process.

The entire organization makes daily, incremental improvements to strengthen what the 
president calls "the fundamentals".

**Self-fertilization**

A project team consisting of members with varying functional specializations, thought
processes, and behavior patterns carries out new product development. The Honda team,
for example, consisted of hand-picked members from R&D, production, and sales.
The company went a step further by placing a wide variety of personalities on the team.
**Such diversity fostered new ideas and concepts**.

While selecting a diverse team is crucial, it isn't unit the members start to interact
the cross-fertilization actually takes place.

>
When all the team members are located in one large room, someone's information becomes
yours, without even trying. You then start thinking in terms of what's best or second
best for the group at large and not only about where you stand. If everyone understands
the other person's position, then each of us is more willing to give in, or at least to
try to talk to each other.
Initiatives emerge as a result.

> a member of Fuji-Xerox FX-3500 project

### Overlapping Development Phases

Although the team members start the project with different time horizons - with R&D people
having the longest time horizon and production people the shortest - **they all must work
toward syncronizing their pace to meet deadlines**. As a result, the team begins to work
as a unit. At some point, the individual's rhythm and the group's rhythm begin to overlap,
creating a whole new pulse. This pulse serves as the driving force and moves the team
forward.
